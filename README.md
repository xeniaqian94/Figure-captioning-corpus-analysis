### Resources
`corpus` is the directory that contains a directory named `figures` and a file named `IELTS-crawled-corpus.json`. 

The `figures` directory contains figures in the `.gif` or `.png` format.

The `IELTS-crawled-corpus.json` contains 95 model answers, where the last 20 answers are commonly annotated by all annotators.

`annotations` is the directory that contains the annotation `.json1` files from the nine annotators. Each line is the annotation for one model answer. 

### Current Effort (May 13, 2020)

At the end of this paper, we noted to release a figure captioning benchmark dataset for the research community. More to come soon in a different repository.
