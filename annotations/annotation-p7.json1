The graph shows changes in the price of fresh fruits and vegetables, sugar and  sweets, and carbonated drinks over a thirty-year archival data in the US between 1979  and  2009. The graph also shows the general upward trend in the consumer price index during this time.

After rising briefly between 1979 and 1981, they  remained  fairly constant until 1999, when the price did begin to increase slowly. In contrast, there was a marked difference in the price of fresh fruits and vegetables,  which, despite constant fluctuations, rose significantly throughout this period.

Complete the answer by filling  the gaps with a word from the box below. The pie charts show the proportion of money spent on various  household expenses in Malaysia and Japan in 2010. We can see that in Malaysia the greatest proportion of expenditure  (34%) was on housing,  whereas  in Japan housing accounted  for just 21% of the total. To the contrary, in Japan the greatest single expense was other goods and services at 29%,  which accounted for 26% in Malaysia.

In Japan another major expense was transport,  at 20%, but this was much minor expense in Malaysia (10%). In both countries the lowest percentage of expenditure  was on health care. Moreover, the data shows that in both cases food, housing and other goods and services were the three highest expenses, sharing much similarity than other comparisons, for example that in Japan, transport and other goods and services took up a significant proportion of total expenditure unlike that in Malaysia.

The percentage of women employed in other non-manual occupations is slightly larger  than the percentage of men in these occupations. In manual employment, the biggest difference between the  two sexes is in the employment of craft workers, where males make up 24% of the  workforce and females just 3%.

Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make  comparisons where relevant.    The bar chart gives information about how many people visited  New York City through three major airports, over a six-year period between 1995  and 2000. Overall, it can be seen that over the period, there was  a fluctuant trend in the number of passengers who travelled via John F. Kennedy  airport, while the other two airports saw an upward trend. Another interesting point  is that LaGuardia airport was the most popular at the end. Looking at the detail, the number of travellers at John  F. Kennedy airport started at 26m in 1995, and then increased remarkably to reach  the highest point of 47m in 1997. In 1999, the figure dipped to 32m. At the last  year, there was a slight growth to 44m. On the other hand, LaGuardia began at 35m  in 1995, after that it rose remarkably for the next three years, at 46m. In 2000,  LaGuardia hit the peak point at 68m travellers. However, if we look at Newark airport, it started at the  lowest point of 16m passengers in the first year. After this point, the trend increased  significantly to 42m in 1998. In the last two years it remained stable at 42m travellers.

The use of electricity in an average  English home is shown in the pie chart. From the graph it is generally obvious that  the demand is in its maximum around 2100 in winter times and in its minimum around  400 being almost constant between 1200 and 2100 in winter times. During summer times  on the other hand the demand reaches its top point around 1300 and the bottom point  around 900 being almost constant between 1550 and 2000.    In wither times the curve gradually increases to reach 40000 units of electricity  by 3 o’clock in the morning. This is followed by gradual decline to its lowest limit  of 30000 units at 9 o’clock. A gradual rise is obvious again to reach a stationary  level between 3 o’clock and 9 o’clock of about 40000 units again.

According to the results of the labor-force research published  recently, the following conclusions can be drawn from it:    In March, 1993, United States had seven percent of their workforce which might not  seem disastrous until compared with Japan, where 2.5% were unemployed. However,  the unemployment rate in United States began declining slowly since March 1993,  and reached 5% mark in the middle of 1996. Japan turned out to be less lucky, as  their unemployment rate doubled in three years. From then on, the percentage of  unemployed workforce in United States remained roughly the same — about 5% until  March 99, although there were minor falls and rises in the unemployment rate.    As for Japan, the percentage of unemployed fell rapidly by 0.5—0.6% after March  1996, but from summer 1996 and onwards it grew steadily and without any falls to  reach 5.0% boundary in March 1999.

As far as women are concerned, the numbers increased in both sectors of education.  The number of part-time female students increased dramatically from 700 thousand  to 1.2 million in the twenty year period. The amount of women in fulltime education  went up more gradually from 100 thousand in 1971 to just over 200 thousand in 1991.  This was similar the increase for fulltime male students.    To sum up, the number of women in both sectors increased significantly while it  seems that the rate of men entering part-time education decreased a little and was  fluctuating.

On the other hand, Women  studying Full-time were increased and not only Full-time, part-time also were increased.  In 1990, studying full-time was three times as many students as in 1970. If compare  Men and Women, as you see, in 1970, Men were studying more than women full-time  or part-time but it changed from 1980 and then, in 1990, Women were studying part-time  more than Men and studying full-time was same number.    It shows you women has a high education now. (132 words) According to this graph, the number of men and women in  farther education in Britain shows that following pattern.  In the case of male, the number of male has declined slightly from about 100 thousands  in 1970/71 to about 850 thousands in 1990/91.

However, the proportion  of part-time education has increased dramatically.  On the other hand, in the case of female, the number of both full-time education  and part-time education has increased during the period.  From about 700 thousands in 1970/71, these figures rose to about 820 thousands in  1980/81, to about 1100 thousands in 1990/91.

It is obvious that the region holding the most oil resources is the Middle East,  with 56.52%, over a half of total world oil resources while in the United States  and Asia, the level of oil consumed each year is for more away from the oil resources  they hold. The percentage of total world oil consumption of United States and Asia  are 25.48% and 26.21% respectively. They are the highest oil consumption region  in the world.    Another place that is worth mentioned will be the Western Europe. With about twenty  percent of total world oil consumption, the Western Europe merely holds less than  1.5% of the oil resources in the World.    Regions that are not mentioned above have the close percentage between oil holding  and consuming whereas Canada has the highest level of oil holding than consuming,  the respective figures are 14.84% and 2.48%.

Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.    The three graphs of wheat exports each show a quite different  pattern between 1985 and 1990. Exports from Australia declined over the five-year  period, while the Canadian market fluctuated considerably, and the European Community  showed an increase.    In 1985, Australia exported about 15 millions of tonnes of wheat and the following  year the number increased by one million tonnes to 16 million. After that, however,  there was a gradual decline until 1989 and 1990 when it stabilised at about 11 million  tonnes. Over the same period, the amount of Canadian exports varied greatly.

Seventeen million tonnes were exported from the European Community in 1985,  but this decreased to 14 million tonnes in 1986 and then rose to 15 million in 1987  and 1988 before increasing once more to 20 million in 1990.
