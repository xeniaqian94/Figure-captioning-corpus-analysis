The graph shows changes in the price of fresh fruits and vegetables, sugar and  sweets, and carbonated drinks over a thirty-year archival data in the US between 1979  and  2009. The graph also shows the general upward trend in the consumer price index during this time. While the consumer price index showed a slow and  steady increase from 1979 to 2009, the same cannot be said for the price of carbonated drinks. After rising briefly between 1979 and 1981, they  remained  fairly constant until 1999, when the price did begin to increase slowly. In contrast, there was a marked difference in the price of fresh fruits and vegetables,  which, despite constant fluctuations, rose significantly throughout this period. In fact, fresh food prices only levelled  out  briefly  between 1990 and 1992 and again went down a little from  2000 to 2001. However,  until 2008 the price had increased by more than 300%.

Complete the answer by filling  the gaps with a word from the box below. The pie charts show the proportion of money spent on various  household expenses in Malaysia and Japan in 2010. We can see that in Malaysia the greatest proportion of expenditure  (34%) was on housing,  whereas  in Japan housing accounted  for just 21% of the total. To the contrary, in Japan the greatest single expense was other goods and services at 29%,  which accounted for 26% in Malaysia.

In Japan another major expense was transport,  at 20%, but this was much minor expense in Malaysia (10%). In both countries the lowest percentage of expenditure  was on health care. Moreover, the data shows that in both cases food, housing and other goods and services were the three highest expenses, sharing much similarity than other comparisons, for example that in Japan, transport and other goods and services took up a significant proportion of total expenditure unlike that in Malaysia.

The percentage of women employed in other non-manual occupations is slightly larger  than the percentage of men in these occupations. In manual employment, the biggest difference between the  two sexes is in the employment of craft workers, where males make up 24% of the  workforce and females just 3%.

Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make  comparisons where relevant.    The bar chart gives information about how many people visited  New York City through three major airports, over a six-year period between 1995  and 2000. Overall, it can be seen that over the period, there was  a fluctuant trend in the number of passengers who travelled via John F. Kennedy  airport, while the other two airports saw an upward trend. Another interesting point  is that LaGuardia airport was the most popular at the end. Looking at the detail, the number of travellers at John  F. Kennedy airport started at 26m in 1995, and then increased remarkably to reach  the highest point of 47m in 1997. In 1999, the figure dipped to 32m. At the last  year, there was a slight growth to 44m. On the other hand, LaGuardia began at 35m  in 1995, after that it rose remarkably for the next three years, at 46m. In 2000,  LaGuardia hit the peak point at 68m travellers. However, if we look at Newark airport, it started at the  lowest point of 16m passengers in the first year. After this point, the trend increased  significantly to 42m in 1998. In the last two years it remained stable at 42m travellers.

Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make  comparisons where relevant.    The chart shows the challenges people face when they settle  in a new country and how the challenges vary according to people’s ages.    The most challenging aspect for young people aged 18 to 34 is making new friends,  a problem experienced by 46% of the people in this age group. However, only 36%  of 35 - 54 year olds find it hard to make friends, while even fewer people over  55 (23%) have this problem.    54% of the older age group finds learning the local language the biggest obstacle  when settling. In comparison, the youngest age group finds this easier, and the  percentage of people who have problems learning the language is much lower, at only  29%.    In contrast to their language-learning difficulties, only 22% of people in the oldest  age group have trouble finding accommodation. However, this is the second most significant  problem for the other two age groups with 39% to 40% of the people in each group  finding it hard.    In general, all age groups experience the same problems to some extent, but people  over the age of 55 reported that they face markedly fewer challenges settling in  a new country than their younger respondents.
