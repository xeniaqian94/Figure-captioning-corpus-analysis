The graph also shows the general upward trend in the consumer price index during this time.

After rising briefly between 1979 and 1981, they  remained  fairly constant until 1999, when the price did begin to increase slowly. In contrast, there was a marked difference in the price of fresh fruits and vegetables,  which, despite constant fluctuations, rose significantly throughout this period.

Complete the answer by filling  the gaps with a word from the box below. The pie charts show the proportion of money spent on various  household expenses in Malaysia and Japan in 2010. We can see that in Malaysia the greatest proportion of expenditure  (34%) was on housing,  whereas  in Japan housing accounted  for just 21% of the total. To the contrary, in Japan the greatest single expense was other goods and services at 29%,  which accounted for 26% in Malaysia.

In Japan another major expense was transport,  at 20%, but this was much minor expense in Malaysia (10%). In both countries the lowest percentage of expenditure  was on health care. Moreover, the data shows that in both cases food, housing and other goods and services were the three highest expenses, sharing much similarity than other comparisons, for example that in Japan, transport and other goods and services took up a significant proportion of total expenditure unlike that in Malaysia.

In contrast to this, the percentage who prefer to travel by car because it is  more comfortable is 40%. The two least important reasons for going to work by car,  with 14% and 11% respectively, is that people need to carry things to work and that  it is safer than cycling to work. Finally, 16% say they prefer driving because it  is faster than cycling. This contrasts with the cyclists who ride to work because  it is faster than driving.

The bar chart gives information about how many people visited  New York City through three major airports, over a six-year period between 1995  and 2000. Overall, it can be seen that over the period, there was  a fluctuant trend in the number of passengers who travelled via John F. Kennedy  airport, while the other two airports saw an upward trend. Another interesting point  is that LaGuardia airport was the most popular at the end. Looking at the detail, the number of travellers at John  F. Kennedy airport started at 26m in 1995, and then increased remarkably to reach  the highest point of 47m in 1997. In 1999, the figure dipped to 32m.

Consumption of Fast Food in the UK     The graph shows changes in the amount  of fast food consumed in the UK between 1970 and 1990. Several trends are apparent.  First, Britons are eating more and more fast food. Secondly, the type of fast food  has changed.    In 1970, the most popular fast food was fish and chips. Over 300g were consumed  each week. By 1990, however, this had fallen to just over 200g - a 50% drop. Consumption  of other fast foods such as pizza and hamburgers increased, however. The amount  of pizza eaten shot up from about 20g a week to more than 270g, overtaking fish  and chips in the late 1980s. Hamburger consumption also increased, rising from about  80g in 1970 to almost 300g in 1990.    Accompanying this change in the choice of foods was an increase in the amount of  fast food consumed. In 1970, British consumers ate about 450g a week of fast food.  In 1990, on the other hand, this had more than doubled, to 1000g.

In households where there are no children, women are reported to work some 30 hours per week in such tasks as housework and gardening. Men's contribution to these unpaid jobs averages a considerably lower 18 hours. When children enter the household, however, the inequality becomes even more pronounced. In families of 1 - 2 children, men maintain approximately the same number of hours of unpaid work as in childless households, but the number of hours women work in the home rises to 52 per week, much of it, on doubt, due to childcare responsibilities. Interestingly, when there are three or more children in the household, men are found to work even fewer hours around the house than before the appearance of the third child. Whereas women's unpaid hours rise to approximately 56 per week, the corresponding figure for men, 16, actually represents a decrease.

(High acid levels are measured by low pH values) Describe the information below and discuss the implications for dental health. You should write at least 150 words. model answer: Anyone who has visited a dentist has been told that eating excessive amounts of sweets risks harming the teeth. This is because sweets lower pH levels in the mouth to dangerous levels. When the pH level in the mouth is kept above 5.5, acidity is such that teeth are unlikely to be in danger of decay. Sweet foods, however, cause pH in the mouth to drop for a time, and the longer pH levels remain below 5.5, the greater the opportunity for decay to occur. By comparing fruit sugar, cane sugar and honey, which are all common ingredients of sweet foods, we find that cane sugar lowers pH levels for the longest period, thus producing the greatest risk of the three. Approximately five minutes aftfter consuming cane sugar, pH levels drop to as little as pH 3.5. They then begin to rise slowly, but do not rise above pH 5.5 until at least 30 minutes have elapsed. By contrast, fruit sugar, which causes the mouth's acidity to fall to just above pH 4, poses a danger for a shorter period: tooth decay is unlikely 20 minutes after consumption. Honey appears an even less risky substance. Though acidity falls to about pH 4.75 within five minutes of consumption, it returns to above pH 5.5 in under fifteen minutes. The implications, then, are that people who insist on eating sweet foods should be aware of the ingredients, and that fruit sugar or honey appear preferable to cane sugar.

Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information.   model answer: The chart shows the changes in the sales of video material / DVDs, games software and CDs around the world in billions of dollars over a three-year period. It can be seen that the sales of videos / DVDs and games software have increased, while the sales of CDs have gone down slightly. Between 2000 and 2003, the sale of videos and DVDs rose by approximately 13 billion dollars. In 2000, just under 20 billion dollars worth of these items were sold, but in 2003, this figure had risen to a little over 30 billion dollars. The sales of games software also rose during this period, but less sharply. Sales increased from about 13 billion dollars in 2000 to just under 20 billion dollars three years later. By contrast, during the same time period, the sale of CDs fell from 35 billion dollars in 2000 to about 32.5 billion dollars in 2003.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[14, 107, "[Compound] bar type + title + label name"], [193, 348, "[Compound] bar type + title + label name"], [349, 478, "[Single] Overall trend"], [479, 572, "[Compound] Overall trend + Estimated value (s)"], [572, 714, "[Compound] Overall trend + Estimated value (s)"], [715, 791, "[Single] Overall trend"], [791, 896, "[Compound] Overall trend + Estimated value (s)"], [938, 1030, "[Compound] Overall trend + Estimated value (s)"]]}

Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.   model answer: The pie chart shows the worldwide distribution of sales of Coca-Cola in the year 2000 and the graph shows the change in share prices between 1996 and 2001. In the year 2000, Coca-Cola sold a total of 17.1 billion cases of their fizzy drink product worldwide. The largest consumer was North America, where 30.4 per cent of the total volume was purchased. The second largest consumer was Latin America. Europe and Asia purchased 20.5 and 16.4 per cent of the total volume respectively, while Africa and the Middle East remained fairly small consumers at 7 per cent of the total volume of sales. Since 1996, share prices for Coca-Cola have fluctuated. In that year, shares were valued at approximately $35. Between 1996 and 1997, however, prices rose significantly to $70 per share. They dipped a little in mid-1997 and then peaked at $80 per share in mid-98. From then until 2000 their value fell consistently but there was a slight rise in mid-2000.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[14, 101, "[Compound] bar type + title + label name"], [198, 353, "[Compound] bar type + title + label name"], [354, 456, "[Single] Value"], [457, 552, "[Compound] Min/max/majority/minority + supporting value (s)"], [552, 790, "[Compound] Compare two labels + supporting value (s)"], [847, 901, "[Single] Value"], [791, 845, "[Single] Overall trend"], [902, 977, "[Compound] Overall trend + supporting value (s)"], [978, 1053, "[Compound] Min/max/majority/minority + supporting value (s)"], [1055, 1146, "[Single] Overall trend"]]}
