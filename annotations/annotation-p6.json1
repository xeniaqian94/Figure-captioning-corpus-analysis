The graph shows changes in the price of fresh fruits and vegetables, sugar and  sweets, and carbonated drinks over a thirty-year archival data in the US between 1979  and  2009. The graph also shows the general upward trend in the consumer price index during this time. While the consumer price index showed a slow and  steady increase from 1979 to 2009, the same cannot be said for the price of carbonated drinks. After rising briefly between 1979 and 1981, they  remained  fairly constant until 1999, when the price did begin to increase slowly. In contrast, there was a marked difference in the price of fresh fruits and vegetables,  which, despite constant fluctuations, rose significantly throughout this period. In fact, fresh food prices only levelled  out  briefly  between 1990 and 1992 and again went down a little from  2000 to 2001. However,  until 2008 the price had increased by more than 300%.

Complete the answer by filling  the gaps with a word from the box below. The pie charts show the proportion of money spent on various  household expenses in Malaysia and Japan in 2010. We can see that in Malaysia the greatest proportion of expenditure  (34%) was on housing,  whereas  in Japan housing accounted  for just 21% of the total. To the contrary, in Japan the greatest single expense was other goods and services at 29%,  which accounted for 26% in Malaysia.

In Japan another major expense was transport,  at 20%, but this was much minor expense in Malaysia (10%). In both countries the lowest percentage of expenditure  was on health care. Moreover, the data shows that in both cases food, housing and other goods and services were the three highest expenses, sharing much similarity than other comparisons, for example that in Japan, transport and other goods and services took up a significant proportion of total expenditure unlike that in Malaysia.

The same amount of people, 30% say that they cycle to work because it causes less  pollution. 13% of people cycle to work because it is cheaper than driving.

In contrast to this, the percentage who prefer to travel by car because it is  more comfortable is 40%. The two least important reasons for going to work by car,  with 14% and 11% respectively, is that people need to carry things to work and that  it is safer than cycling to work. Finally, 16% say they prefer driving because it  is faster than cycling. This contrasts with the cyclists who ride to work because  it is faster than driving.

In 2005, we can see that tourism was the greatest  exports earner of the three industries, with revenue standing at just over $6 billion.

Employees  and self-employed: by sex and occupation, 1992     The charts provide information on the proportion of males  and females in employment in 6 broad categories, divided into manual and non-manual  occupations. In general, a greater percentage of women work in non-manual occupations  than work in manual occupations, and the reverse is true for men. In the non-manual occupations, while a greater percentage  of working women than men are found in clerical-type positions, there is a smaller  percentage of women than men employed in managerial and professional positions.  The percentage of women employed in other non-manual occupations is slightly larger  than the percentage of men in these occupations. In manual employment, the biggest difference between the  two sexes is in the employment of craft workers, where males make up 24% of the  workforce and females just 3%. Furthermore, the percentage of women working as general  working as general labourers is very small, only 1%. There is not a great deal of  difference between the percentage of men doing other forms of manual work (26%)  and women in other manual work (27%).

Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make  comparisons where relevant.    The bar chart gives information about how many people visited  New York City through three major airports, over a six-year period between 1995  and 2000. Overall, it can be seen that over the period, there was  a fluctuant trend in the number of passengers who travelled via John F. Kennedy  airport, while the other two airports saw an upward trend. Another interesting point  is that LaGuardia airport was the most popular at the end. Looking at the detail, the number of travellers at John  F. Kennedy airport started at 26m in 1995, and then increased remarkably to reach  the highest point of 47m in 1997. In 1999, the figure dipped to 32m.

For this reason, some universities insist that all  students must complete a Work Experience Requirement. Completing the following  six stages results in the requirements’ fulfillment.    The process begins with the Application stage. A student reviews an approved  list of workplaces and submits applications to places where he would like to  work. Next is the Approval stage. When a student receives an acceptance letter,  he gives it to the professor for approval. The third stage, Schedule, requires a  student to arrange his work schedule. The student should work at least 10  hours/week over 20 weeks. Reports are next. The student must complete a Weekly  Report Form and turn it in to the professor every Friday.    The fifth stage, Evaluation, takes place during the final work week. A student  participates in an evaluation meeting with his work supervisor, who submits an  Evaluation Form. The last stage requires that a student submit a Final Report  before the last week of spring semester.

Overall, most of the countries included in the graph have more mobile phones subscribers than landlines.  Most European countries have high mobile phone use. The biggest users of mobile phones are the Italians, with 88 cell phones per 100 people. For example, Italy has twice as many mobile phones as landlines, with 88 mobiles per hundred people compared to 45 for landlines. Mobile phone use is low in Canada, with fewer than 40 phones per 100 people. Denmark is also unusual because it has slightly more landlines than mobile phones.  However, in some countries, the number of landlines is higher than the number of mobile phones. One example is the USA, where the number of mobiles, at 50 per 100 people, is much lower than the number of landlines, at almost 70 per hundred. A similar pattern can be seen in Canada.

Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant. model answer: The graph shows changes in the age profile of Internet users in Taiwan between 1998 and 2000. The main users of the Internet in Taiwan are young adults between 16 and 30 years old. In 1998, they accounted for more than half of all users. In 1999 the number dropped slightly to 45%, but even in 2000 they were the biggest group. The second biggest group of users is aged between 31 and 50. They made up 41% in 1998, falling slightly to 37% in 2000. When combined with the 16-30 age group, over 94% of users in 1998 were between 16 and 50.  However this number is dropping steadily as more children and older users log on. In 1999, the number of children online quadrupled from 2% to 8%, and it continued to increase in 2000. There were similar increases for older users, rising from 4% in 1998 to 10% in 2000.  In summary, while adults between 16 and 50 still represent the great majority of Internet users in Taiwan, their share is declining as more children and older users join the web.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[205, 298, "[Compound] Title + label name"], [299, 385, "[Single] Overall trend"], [386, 442, "[Compound] Min/max/majority/minority + supporting value (s)"], [443, 532, "[Compound] Min/max/majority/minority + supporting value (s)"], [533, 592, "[Single] Min/max/majority/minority"], [594, 652, "[Compound] Min/max/majority/minority + supporting value (s)"], [752, 824, "[Single] Overall trend"], [929, 1017, "[Compound] Overall trend + supporting value (s)"], [826, 928, "[Compound] Overall trend + supporting value (s)"], [1032, 1192, "[Single] Overall trend"], [653, 741, "[Compound] Min/max/majority/minority + supporting value (s)"]]}
