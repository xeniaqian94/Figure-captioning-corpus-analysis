The graph shows changes in the price of fresh fruits and vegetables, sugar and  sweets, and carbonated drinks over a thirty-year archival data in the US between 1979  and  2009. The graph also shows the general upward trend in the consumer price index during this time. While the consumer price index showed a slow and  steady increase from 1979 to 2009, the same cannot be said for the price of carbonated drinks. After rising briefly between 1979 and 1981, they  remained  fairly constant until 1999, when the price did begin to increase slowly. In contrast, there was a marked difference in the price of fresh fruits and vegetables,  which, despite constant fluctuations, rose significantly throughout this period.

Complete the answer by filling  the gaps with a word from the box below. The pie charts show the proportion of money spent on various  household expenses in Malaysia and Japan in 2010. We can see that in Malaysia the greatest proportion of expenditure  (34%) was on housing,  whereas  in Japan housing accounted  for just 21% of the total. To the contrary, in Japan the greatest single expense was other goods and services at 29%,  which accounted for 26% in Malaysia.

In Japan another major expense was transport,  at 20%, but this was much minor expense in Malaysia (10%). In both countries the lowest percentage of expenditure  was on health care. Moreover, the data shows that in both cases food, housing and other goods and services were the three highest expenses, sharing much similarity than other comparisons, for example that in Japan, transport and other goods and services took up a significant proportion of total expenditure unlike that in Malaysia.

Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make  comparisons where relevant.    The bar chart gives information about how many people visited  New York City through three major airports, over a six-year period between 1995  and 2000. Overall, it can be seen that over the period, there was  a fluctuant trend in the number of passengers who travelled via John F. Kennedy  airport, while the other two airports saw an upward trend. Another interesting point  is that LaGuardia airport was the most popular at the end. Looking at the detail, the number of travellers at John  F. Kennedy airport started at 26m in 1995, and then increased remarkably to reach  the highest point of 47m in 1997. In 1999, the figure dipped to 32m. At the last  year, there was a slight growth to 44m. On the other hand, LaGuardia began at 35m  in 1995, after that it rose remarkably for the next three years, at 46m. In 2000,  LaGuardia hit the peak point at 68m travellers. However, if we look at Newark airport, it started at the  lowest point of 16m passengers in the first year. After this point, the trend increased  significantly to 42m in 1998. In the last two years it remained stable at 42m travellers.

Summarize the information by choosing and describe the main idea, and make comparisons where appropriate. You should write at least 150 words. model answer: The graph shows changes in employment rates in six countries between 1995 and 2005, for men and women. Overall more and more people of working age are employed, and there have been significant improvements for women, although they leg behind men in entering the workforce. The most obvious trend in the graph is that women have lower employment rates in most of the countries in the graph. For example, in Australia in 1995, 57 percent of men could find work or retain a job, but only 27 percent of women. The difference was even bigger in New Zealand, with 60 percent of women. Even in Switzerland and Iceland, alightly more men than women were in the job market. The second biggest trend in the graph is the improvement in employment between 1995 and 2005. In all countries shown, figures for both men and women improved. The biggest change was in the United Kingdom, from 55 percent of men in 1995 to 73 percent over the ten years period. Furthermore, the increases in employment rates for women were much higher in New Zealand. The percentage of working women jumped from 25 percent to 42 percent, and in the United States from 45 percent to 61 percent over the decade.

{"id": 497, "text": "672   g122.png    The graph below shows the  demand for electricity in England during typical days in winter and summer. The  pie chart shows how electricity is used in an average English home.    Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make  comparisons where relevant. You should write at least 150 words.   The Demand for electricity in England during typical days  in winter and summer is illustrated in the graph. The use of electricity in an average  English home is shown in the pie chart. From the graph it is generally obvious that  the demand is in its maximum around 2100 in winter times and in its minimum around  400 being almost constant between 1200 and 2100 in winter times. During summer times  on the other hand the demand reaches its top point around 1300 and the bottom point  around 900 being almost constant between 1550 and 2000.    In wither times the curve gradually increases to reach 40000 units of electricity  by 3 o’clock in the morning. This is followed by gradual decline to its lowest limit  of 30000 units at 9 o’clock. A gradual rise is obvious again to reach a stationary  level between 3 o’clock and 9 o’clock of about 40000 units again. Then there is  a sharp rise in the next hour to reach its maximum before collapsing again to a  lower level by the end of the day.    In summer time the curve gradually decrease to reach its lower limit around 9 o’clock  of a bit more that 10000 units. A gradual increase is noticed to reach its top of  20000 after which a stationary phase is obvious between 3 o’clock and 10 o’clock  at night of about 15000 units.    The pie chart on the other hand shows that 52.5% of the electricity is used for  heating rooms and water. 17.5% is consumed for ovens kettles and washing machines  15% is used in lighting TV and radio and finally 15% is consumed in the sue of vacuum  cleaners food mixtures and electric tools.
