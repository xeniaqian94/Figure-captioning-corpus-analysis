The graph shows changes in the price of fresh fruits and vegetables, sugar and  sweets, and carbonated drinks over a thirty-year archival data in the US between 1979  and  2009. The graph also shows the general upward trend in the consumer price index during this time.

After rising briefly between 1979 and 1981, they  remained  fairly constant until 1999, when the price did begin to increase slowly. In contrast, there was a marked difference in the price of fresh fruits and vegetables,  which, despite constant fluctuations, rose significantly throughout this period. In fact, fresh food prices only levelled  out  briefly  between 1990 and 1992 and again went down a little from  2000 to 2001. However,  until 2008 the price had increased by more than 300%.

Complete the answer by filling  the gaps with a word from the box below. The pie charts show the proportion of money spent on various  household expenses in Malaysia and Japan in 2010. We can see that in Malaysia the greatest proportion of expenditure  (34%) was on housing,  whereas  in Japan housing accounted  for just 21% of the total. To the contrary, in Japan the greatest single expense was other goods and services at 29%,  which accounted for 26% in Malaysia. Food came in second place in Japan, at 24%, while in Malaysia the actual proportion was the third (27%). In Japan another major expense was transport,  at 20%, but this was much minor expense in Malaysia (10%). In both countries the lowest percentage of expenditure  was on health care. Moreover, the data shows that in both cases food, housing and other goods and services were the three highest expenses, sharing much similarity than other comparisons, for example that in Japan, transport and other goods and services took up a significant proportion of total expenditure unlike that in Malaysia.

In 2005, we can see that tourism was the greatest  exports earner of the three industries, with revenue standing at just over $6 billion.

Experts are predicting that  exports in this area may fall slightly, so a figure of $7.5 billion is expected  for 2025.

Employees  and self-employed: by sex and occupation, 1992     The charts provide information on the proportion of males  and females in employment in 6 broad categories, divided into manual and non-manual  occupations. In general, a greater percentage of women work in non-manual occupations  than work in manual occupations, and the reverse is true for men. In the non-manual occupations, while a greater percentage  of working women than men are found in clerical-type positions, there is a smaller  percentage of women than men employed in managerial and professional positions.  The percentage of women employed in other non-manual occupations is slightly larger  than the percentage of men in these occupations. In manual employment, the biggest difference between the  two sexes is in the employment of craft workers, where males make up 24% of the  workforce and females just 3%. Furthermore, the percentage of women working as general  working as general labourers is very small, only 1%. There is not a great deal of  difference between the percentage of men doing other forms of manual work (26%)  and women in other manual work (27%).

The bar chart gives information about how many people visited  New York City through three major airports, over a six-year period between 1995  and 2000.

Another interesting point  is that LaGuardia airport was the most popular at the end. Looking at the detail, the number of travellers at John  F. Kennedy airport started at 26m in 1995, and then increased remarkably to reach  the highest point of 47m in 1997. In 1999, the figure dipped to 32m.

{"id": 346, "text": "769   IELTS_Writing_Task_1_146.png    The chart below shows the  percentage change in the share of international students among university graduates  in different Canadian provinces between 2001 and 2006.    Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make  comparisons where relevant.     Source: Statistics Canada, Postsecondary Student Information System  The chart shows changes in the share of international students  who graduated from universities in different Canadian provinces over a period of  5 years.    In 2001, this share had a relatively narrow range, from 3% in Ontario to 7.0% in  New Brunswick. Nova Scotia had the second highest proportion at 6.5%. Five years  later, the figures for most provinces had risen, with the exception of Alberta.  There, the figures fell by 1% to just over 4%.    By 2006, some parts of Canada experienced a considerable increase in their share  of international graduates. Growth in this share was especially strong in the case of New Brunswick, where the figures rose from 7% to 12%. The largest growth occurred in British Columbia, where it more than doubled to 11%.    Over this five-year period, changes in the proportion of international graduates  have been very uneven across the provinces of Canada. However, New Brunswick remained  the province with the highest percentage overall.

{"id": 345, "text": "768   IELTS_Writing_Diagram.png    The diagrams show a structure  that is used to generate electricity from wave power.    Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make  comparisons where relevant.   Generating electricity from sea waves   The two diagrams show how electricity can be generated from  the rise and fall of water caused by sea waves.    The process involves a structure which is mounted on the side of a cliff or sea  wall. This structure consists of a large chamber. One end is open to the sea, and  the other leads into a vertical column, which is open to the atmosphere. A turbine  is installed inside this column and this is used to generate the electricity in  two phases.    The first diagram indicates that when a wave approaches the device, water is forced  into the chamber, applying pressure on the air within the column. This air escapes  to atmosphere through the turbine, thereby producing electricity.    The second diagram illustrates the next part of the process when wave retreats.  As the water level falls, the air from outside the column is sucked back in through  the turbine. As a result, electricity continues to be generated. The turbine rotates  only in one direction, regardless of the direction of the air flow.    In conclusion, we can see that this structure is useful as electricity is generated  in both phases: entering and retreating of water.

{"id": 344, "text": "767   IELTS_Writing_Task_1_145.png       The chart below gives information about the UK's ageing population in  1985 and makes predictions for 2035.      Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.      Source: Office for National Statistics, National Records of Scotland, Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency   The graph shows how the size and distribution of the UK's ageing population is  likely to change over a 50-year period.    Overall, the proportions are predicted to increase in all UK countries. In 1985,  15 per cent of the UK population was over 65, but by 2035, this will account for  23 per cent of the total population.    A closer look at the data reveals that the ageing population is expected to rise  more in some parts of the UK than in other. In 1985, Wales had the highest  percentage of people aged 65 and over, at 16 per cent. The second-largest group  could be found in England and the third in Scotland. Northern Ireland had lowest  proportion, with 12 per cent aged 65 and over.    By 2035, Wales is still going to have by far the greatest percentage of over  65s, with figures likely to reach 26 per cent. However, the biggest increases in  this age group, relative to the rest of the population, are predicted to occur  in Northern Ireland and Scotland. In Northern Ireland, for example, this figure  will increase almost double to 23 per cent.
