The graph shows changes in the price of fresh fruits and vegetables, sugar and  sweets, and carbonated drinks over a thirty-year archival data in the US between 1979  and  2009. The graph also shows the general upward trend in the consumer price index during this time. While the consumer price index showed a slow and  steady increase from 1979 to 2009, the same cannot be said for the price of carbonated drinks. After rising briefly between 1979 and 1981, they  remained  fairly constant until 1999, when the price did begin to increase slowly. In contrast, there was a marked difference in the price of fresh fruits and vegetables,  which, despite constant fluctuations, rose significantly throughout this period. In fact, fresh food prices only levelled  out  briefly  between 1990 and 1992 and again went down a little from  2000 to 2001. However,  until 2008 the price had increased by more than 300%.

Complete the answer by filling  the gaps with a word from the box below. The pie charts show the proportion of money spent on various  household expenses in Malaysia and Japan in 2010. We can see that in Malaysia the greatest proportion of expenditure  (34%) was on housing,  whereas  in Japan housing accounted  for just 21% of the total. To the contrary, in Japan the greatest single expense was other goods and services at 29%,  which accounted for 26% in Malaysia.

In Japan another major expense was transport,  at 20%, but this was much minor expense in Malaysia (10%). In both countries the lowest percentage of expenditure  was on health care. Moreover, the data shows that in both cases food, housing and other goods and services were the three highest expenses, sharing much similarity than other comparisons, for example that in Japan, transport and other goods and services took up a significant proportion of total expenditure unlike that in Malaysia.

It also indicates future projections for 2025. According to the data,  it seems likely that international tourism will become the dominant industry, although  dairy exports will remain strong. In 2005, we can see that tourism was the greatest  exports earner of the three industries, with revenue standing at just over $6 billion. This figure has increased slightly, so that now, in 2015, it has reached almost  $7 billion. It is estimated that international tourism will continue to grow, so  that by 2025, it will be earning around $8 billion for the country. In 2000, dairy  exports were worth around $5 billion, but since then there has been a dramatic increase,  and sales for this year are approximately $8 billion. Experts are predicting that  exports in this area may fall slightly, so a figure of $7.5 billion is expected  for 2025. Meat products are the third key industry in Someland, but sales have dropped  since 2000 and now stand at $3.5 billion. It is expected that sales will continue  to decrease in the future.

Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make  comparisons where relevant.    The bar chart gives information about how many people visited  New York City through three major airports, over a six-year period between 1995  and 2000. Overall, it can be seen that over the period, there was  a fluctuant trend in the number of passengers who travelled via John F. Kennedy  airport, while the other two airports saw an upward trend. Another interesting point  is that LaGuardia airport was the most popular at the end. Looking at the detail, the number of travellers at John  F. Kennedy airport started at 26m in 1995, and then increased remarkably to reach  the highest point of 47m in 1997. In 1999, the figure dipped to 32m. At the last  year, there was a slight growth to 44m. On the other hand, LaGuardia began at 35m  in 1995, after that it rose remarkably for the next three years, at 46m. In 2000,  LaGuardia hit the peak point at 68m travellers. However, if we look at Newark airport, it started at the  lowest point of 16m passengers in the first year. After this point, the trend increased  significantly to 42m in 1998. In the last two years it remained stable at 42m travellers.

National and international landline calls grew steadily from 6000 million to 10500  million at the end of the period in question, though the growth slowed over the  last two years.    There was a dramatic increase in mobile calls from 250 to 9800 million minutes.  This rise was particularly noticeable between 2000 and 2004, during which time the  use of mobile phones tripled.    To sum up, although local landline calls were still the most popular in 2004, the  gap between the three categories had narrowed considerately over the second half  of the period in question.

Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make  comparisons where relevant.    The graph shows the overall numbers of tourist arrivals  in five countries between 1995 and 2010. In 1995 over 70 million tourists visited  the United States, more than twice as many as the next most popular destination  shown, France. However, between 2005 and 2010 there was a decrease of approximately  1,500,000 in the numbers going to the United States whereas there was an increase  of nearly 20 million tourists visiting France. The result was that in 2010 the number  of tourists arriving in the United States and France was almost equal at around  90 million each.     The number of tourists visiting Malaysia rose steadily over the whole period but  by 2010 the total was still under 50 million. The countries with the fewest tourist  arrivals were Brazil and Egypt. The number of tourists going there was similar between  1995 and 2000 but after that there was a greater increase in tourists going to Egypt  than to Brazil.
