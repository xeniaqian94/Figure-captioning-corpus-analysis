The graph shows changes in the price of fresh fruits and vegetables, sugar and  sweets, and carbonated drinks over a thirty-year archival data in the US between 1979  and  2009. The graph also shows the general upward trend in the consumer price index during this time. While the consumer price index showed a slow and  steady increase from 1979 to 2009, the same cannot be said for the price of carbonated drinks. After rising briefly between 1979 and 1981, they  remained  fairly constant until 1999, when the price did begin to increase slowly. In contrast, there was a marked difference in the price of fresh fruits and vegetables,  which, despite constant fluctuations, rose significantly throughout this period. In fact, fresh food prices only levelled  out  briefly  between 1990 and 1992 and again went down a little from  2000 to 2001. However,  until 2008 the price had increased by more than 300%.

Complete the answer by filling  the gaps with a word from the box below. The pie charts show the proportion of money spent on various  household expenses in Malaysia and Japan in 2010. We can see that in Malaysia the greatest proportion of expenditure  (34%) was on housing,  whereas  in Japan housing accounted  for just 21% of the total. To the contrary, in Japan the greatest single expense was other goods and services at 29%,  which accounted for 26% in Malaysia.

In manual employment, the biggest difference between the  two sexes is in the employment of craft workers, where males make up 24% of the  workforce and females just 3%. Furthermore, the percentage of women working as general  working as general labourers is very small, only 1%. There is not a great deal of  difference between the percentage of men doing other forms of manual work (26%)  and women in other manual work (27%).

Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make  comparisons where relevant.    The bar chart gives information about how many people visited  New York City through three major airports, over a six-year period between 1995  and 2000. Overall, it can be seen that over the period, there was  a fluctuant trend in the number of passengers who travelled via John F. Kennedy  airport, while the other two airports saw an upward trend. Another interesting point  is that LaGuardia airport was the most popular at the end. Looking at the detail, the number of travellers at John  F. Kennedy airport started at 26m in 1995, and then increased remarkably to reach  the highest point of 47m in 1997. In 1999, the figure dipped to 32m. At the last  year, there was a slight growth to 44m. On the other hand, LaGuardia began at 35m  in 1995, after that it rose remarkably for the next three years, at 46m. In 2000,  LaGuardia hit the peak point at 68m travellers. However, if we look at Newark airport, it started at the  lowest point of 16m passengers in the first year. After this point, the trend increased  significantly to 42m in 1998. In the last two years it remained stable at 42m travellers.

First, Britons are eating more and more fast food. Secondly, the type of fast food  has changed.    In 1970, the most popular fast food was fish and chips. Over 300g were consumed  each week.

In contrast, countries such as Egypt, Morocco and Syria have less than 20 computers per 1000 inhabitants.  There are also great differences in Internet use and availability. The UAE has by far the highest proportion of users, with more than one-third of its population using the Internet. Kuwait and Lebanon are second and third again, with 100 users per thousand in Kuwait and 80 in Lebanon. In some countries the number using the Internet is negligible: Saudi Arabia has less than 20 users per thousand, and there are fewer than 5 users per thousand in Syria. One unusual feature of the graph is that Internet use does not seem to be directly related to the number of computers. In several countries (the UAE, Lebanon, Jordan and Oman), there are more Internet users per thousand people than computers. However, in other countries, such as Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Syria, the number of Internet users is lower than the number of computers. In summary, there are major differences between computer use and Internet use in the Arab world, but the UAE clearly leads the area in both number of computers and number of internet users per capita.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[0, 3, "Broken exercise ..."], [94, 198, "[Compound] Title + label name"], [201, 292, "[Single] Min/max/majority/minority"], [294, 394, "[Compound] Compare two labels + supporting value (s)"], [396, 500, "[Compound] Compare two labels + supporting value (s)"], [503, 568, "[Single] Overall trend"], [570, 683, "[Compound] Min/max/majority/minority + supporting value (s)"], [685, 787, "[Single] Value"], [789, 956, "[Single] Value"], [958, 1075, "[Single] Overall trend"], [1077, 1199, "[Single] Compare (between two labels; higher/lower/larger/smaller/increase/rise)"], [1210, 1336, "[Single] Compare (between two labels; higher/lower/larger/smaller/increase/rise)"], [1350, 1537, "[Single] Overall trend"]]}
{"id": 166, "text": "101   g29.gif   Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information in the graph below.     model answer: The graph compares the rate of smoking in men and women in Someland between the years 1960 and 2000. It can be clearly seen that the rate of smoking for both men and women is currently declining and that fewer women have smoked throughout the period. In 1960, 600 men in every 1,000 was smoking. This number decreased gradually to 500 by 1974 and continued to decrease but more steeply to 250 in 2000. In contrast, the rate of smoking in women in 1960 was very low at only 80 in every 1,000. By 1968 this increased to 170, and increased again but more steeply to 320 in 1977. The rate of female smokers then remained stable at 320 until 1984 at which point the figures began to decline and had dropped to 200 by 2000. In conclusion we can see that the rate of smoking in men dropped throughout the whole period but was always at a higher level than the female figures. The rate of smoking in women increased until 1977 but then decreased for the rest of the period.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[0, 3, "Broken exercise ..."], [122, 221, "[Compound] Title + label name"], [223, 371, "[Compound] Overall trend + compare"], [373, 416, "[Single] Value"], [418, 522, "[Compound] Overall trend + supporting value (s)"], [537, 612, "[Single] Value"], [614, 696, "[Compound] Overall trend + supporting value (s)"], [698, 838, "[Compound] Overall trend + supporting value (s)"], [840, 989, "[Single] Overall trend"], [991, 1086, "[Single] Overall trend"]]}
